ICA8 Testing Assignment

Test Driven Development

Problem Statement:

Write a code that returns the maximum of free urinals as an integer according to the unwritten rule of urinal checkmate.

Solution:

1. Create Urinals.java and UrinalsTest.java file for development and writing test cases respectively.
2. Main.java file is created to check final end to end code. 
Input file is stored in main/java/resources/urinal.dat.
Output get stores in main/java/Output/rule.txt.
3. For testing purposes, 
   Run src/test/java/Urinals tests.
   Input is stored in test/java/resources/urinal.dat.
   Output get stores in test/java/Output/rule.txt.
4. I replace goodString() function with verifyValidString() which uses regex to check valid string.
